# Creative Portion

#### Compress
The compress function has achieved to compress and package multiple files into one single zip file. 
In this portion, users can choose files, pressing the "Compress" bottom. And then the zip file will be added into the file list of this user, which is named by the time that the user created it. (by the 
American/Chicago time zone)


#### Register/Sign up
The register function allows new users to create a new account. When the user clicks on the bottom and type in their new username, the name will be added into the user.txt, which is of course
not be able to watch by all the users. By the next time entering the login page, the user can type their username, which just added, to log-in.

#### Multiple files Display/Delete/Download
The most user-friendly part of our file sharing site is that it can not only deal with a single file.
* Delete: Users can choose multiple files and delete.
* Display: Users can choose multiple files to display. They will all be displayed on a page.
* Download: When choosing the multiple files, it will actually head to compress first, and then can come back to the download.php, be treated as a single file. Users will always stay on the download page, only need to choose the files and click on the bottom. The zip file will be downloaded in local.

* You can also sign up, thank you!
